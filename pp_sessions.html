				<div class="revealed">
			The party, consisting of human lawful good male paladin Jamfalcon Dawntracker, dwarven chaotic good female wizard Ezri Laughshield, and human chaotic neutral beguiler Korban Rask begin the campaign passed out at the end of a pier near an industrial seaport at about 6 am of what we will refer to as Day 1. Korban looks like a crazy-eyed Tom Petty, with a creepy hat, Jamfalcon looks like smelly Jake Gyllenhaal, and Ezri looks like a young Rosie O'Donnell.
<br><br>
Ezri is awoken by kicks from a young waif who instructs her to seek out Master Dino, younger brother of Yarto (who she claims is the greatest warrior since the Unimpeachable herself), who’s looking for them. She directs them to the Lusty Penny. Before they can leave the pier they are on, they are set upon by two vaguely foreign sounding human toughs, who are looking for a good mugging. At Korban’s mention of Yarto, they lose interest and wander off.
<br><br>
As they approach the Lusty Penny, they encounter Charly the itinerant preacher, delivering an impromptu sermon before being escorted back to lockup for this very crime. He makes veiled references to a martyr named Lucius, and the legality of faith.
<br><br>
Inside the Lusty Penny, the party meets Josef, a young employee who is mopping up from last night’s revelry, and Jamfalcon doesn't ask too many questions about Korban's gifted boot. Unwilling to ask him directly about Dino, they consult a drunkard named Harrold and eventually learn from Josef that they just missed Dino, as he was headed to the Salty Siren next. Ezri invents the game of Coasters amidst very impressive card shuffling sounds, and Harrold goes 1 for 2. Not a bad record for an ad hoc con with arbitrary rules.
<br><br>
A passerby indicates to the party the location of the Salty Siren, and they head off NE. Along the way they hear a rumour of the Crimson Forgery and Emerald Palace being tagged in the same night, whatever that means. The party eventually comes to the Salty Siren, and are denied entry by a large violent bouncer, but bluff their way into the service entrance via a telekinetic letter box clang, and an illusory potato sack.
<br><br>
The party distracts the kitchen staff with a loud TK pot clang, and proceed to the dining room, in which they see a greeter, a couple patrons and wait staff, and a bartender. Korban approaches the elderly bartender, who is the epitome of charm and hospitality. He indicates Dino was just here, and that he was off to the Crimson Forgery in a hurry, and that it was an odd time of day for his old man to summon him (who is a friend of his). It is about 10 am. The party members do a round of shots and waltz out the front door of the Salty Siren like they own the place, now wearing clean, if ill-fitting clothes, and a decided lack of repellent odour. Except maybe Jamfalcon.

			<div class="expandable" id="expandable-1">
				<div class="revealed">
					Having once again shown up somewhere too late to meet up with this "Master Dino", the party follows the lead given to them by the Salty Siren's bartender that he was next on his way to the Crimson Forgery, having apparently been recalled there by his father Ronold on what may be urgent business. After harassing a dry bread thief trying his best to serve out his remaining day of community service as a barker / human cow for the fishing community at large, they proceed through the gate into the Crimson Hexad.
					<br><br>
					Upon crossing into this new district, the party is immediately drawn to a large statue commemmorating a famous matriarch of Clan Cullis, Vako the Saviour. She appears to have been a warrior and ruler among other things. They head to the nearest building they see which looks like a small castle, and is the Crimson Forgery emblazoned with the motto <i>Semper Defendemus</i>. After successfully passing the main gate by name-dropping both Dino and Ronold, they enter the bailey, where they finally meet Dino. He is rather friendly and chats the party up about last night's carousing. They talk and walk toward Dino's house.
					<br><Br>
					Arriving at Dino's house after a few minutes, he asks the party by way of a favour to go to Yarto's house to retrieve his coin purse, walk Kenzy, and make sure "everything looks OK". Yarto's "house" is a carbon copy of Dino's apartment, albeit on the second storey. The party gains entry, walks the dog, tidies up, pilfers hardtack, and generally pokes around. Dino gives them most of the gold as their winnings from last night's gambling, but seems mostly interested in the state of Yarto's apartment. Once the tunic button is shown to Dino he declares it looks "Hafoyn" and wants that hunch verified by a friend. He thinks it's best he makes the party's introduction in person. The party learns that Yarto is missing, but also that he is prone to take off on hunting trips. Dino (mostly?) believes this is the case.
				<br><br>
					Back in the docks, the party runs into Harrold again, this time regaling children with a spooky story of a Dark Day encounter from years past. With gold burning holes in pockets (roll your pocket checks) the party seeks out arms and armour. Before they get there, Jamfalcon has an unnerving month-long-but-half-minute mental encounter with a cloaked figure, and subsequently, a greasy fishmonger. They head into Larry's Weapon Shoppe and after Ezri charms Larry, receive competitive prices on mundane weapons. Daryl from Daryl's Armour et Cetera is less congenial, despite (or because of) a letter of recommendation from Larry.
				<br><br>
					Finally, once outside again, Dino is approached by a friend named Jon who does not seem himself. Jon seems to be internally struggling, but he ultimately attacks Dino. The party uses a masterful and humane combination of disarming technique and non-lethal damage to subdue Jon (except that time someone tried to stab him in the leg, but no harm no foul I guess?), who is arrested for attempted murder and taken to the Docks Constabulary for healing/questioning.

			<div class="expandable" id="expandable-2">
				<div class="revealed">
					After the unsuccessful and puzzling attack on Dino's life, he leads the party to his 'friend' to authenticate the tunic button found in Yarto's apartment. This turns out to be a back room in a shop of sorts, where they meet Dino's friend, the Bookie, in his secluded sanctum. The Bookie initiates a time-honoured tradition for assessing new acquaintances: The Game of Lies. The party elects Korban to represent them in this duel. Despite losing the contest, the Bookie encourages a future rematch, and agrees to examine the tunic button, which he declares to be a nearly perfect forgery. Unsettled by the attack and the button's murky origin, Dino decides to retreat to the Crimson Hexad, in the hopes of defusing any heightening of tension due to the optics of these events by running interference with his mother.<br><br>
					Seeing the afternoon turn to evening, the party decides to seek accommodations nearby, and inquire at the Derelict Pugilist, a 'discount' but relatively safe and clean lodging near the Bookie's. After paying a week's rent, they head north to the Golden Gate, at concierge 'Aunt' Patty's recommendation, for some "Oh So Good" Cullish dining. Sated with bellies full, they head east to find an establishment Korban is interested in, The Dug Skull. On their way they witness a purse snatching, and are compelled to intervene on an elderly lady's behalf. Ezri casts her newly learnt Grease spell, and the hapless thief hits the dirt, still clinging to the purse. Flinging himself into the fray, without a second thought to his safety or clean clothes, Jamfalcon gallantly charges into a greasy wrestling match with the criminal, but ultimately the party subdues him with lethal force. Jamfalcon puts his healing smarts to use so the perp will face justice, and the purse is returned to its owner.
					<br><Br>
					The Dug Skull is a rogue's dream shop, thinly veneered as a totally legal locksmithing and security shop. The proprietor, Dug Haberdash, sells Korban some goods, and tells them to come back tomorrow for deatails about a potential job. On the way back to their inn, the party encounters a shady figure named "S B" in an alley, who attempts rather unsucessfully to engage the party in conversation. Back in their room, caltrops are laid, and watches set. In the third and final watch, Ezri hears some noise and alerts the party. They investigate only to be attacked by two large rats. Naturally, the party slips out at dawn to nail them to Larry's (Armour et Cetera) door, and waits down the street to see if their prank bears fruit. Larry shows up early, assumes the rat-nailing is the work of his rival Daryl, and nails them to <em>his</em> door.
					<br><br>
					Famished from their busy night, the party heads to the Cerulean Sky, a nearby Esao-run establishment, where they break fast and chat up their server, Kasis. They head back to the Dug Skull, but come upon an enormous white wolf and a druid. He claims to be in need of an odd assortment of supplies that he can't furnish himself, on account of his self-proclaimed notoreity, and the legal problem of having any sort of connection to divinity. The party tacitly accepts to fulfill his list, are paid 10 GP with the promise of the 10 more on delivery. Once again at the Dug Skull, Dug details a job that he subcontracts to the party, wherein a door in a basement needs opening, for a payment of 30 GP.

			<div class="expandable" id="expandable-3">
				<div class="revealed">
					The party proceeds to the building described by Dug in his mission to open a lock in a basement, which appears to be disused storage shed. It is quite early on Break Day, with minimal passers by, so Korban casts Message on Ezri and Jamfalcon, and they act as lookouts to the west and east, while he picks the lock. Inside, the main room is heavily defaced, and contains nothing of value. The one door inside is also locked, with a fairly obvious tripwire trap that Korban disables. In the closet, several pieces of "animal handling" gear are acquired, and the party, once again reunited, begin descent to the basement via a trapdoor in the closet floor.<BR><br>
					Since only Ezri can see properly in the basement, Korban casts Dancing Lights, and he and Jamfalcon being surveying the two doors in this 10x10 foot basement closet. They ultimately discover that the eastern door will not succumb to Korban's lockpicks - however - the western door, and the next two doors introduced to Jamfalcon's shoulder, sunder with aplomb. This final doorcrashing reveals a thieves' den, wherein two neophyte footpads are stunned at the rather imposing green-paint-soaked, dog-armour-wearing Jamfalcon and his tasteful entrance (no silly paint trap will slow <em>him</em> down). The thieves instinctively fight to repel the invader(s).<bR><br>
					After some of Ezri's pyrotechnics, and a token level of feigned restraint, the two thieves are put down, but Jamfalcon is willing and able to stabilize one of them before he sheds his mortal coil. Upon searching, they find a veritable cornucopia of coins, mundane goods and weapons, and a couple of lightly enchanted items. A quick peek to the room above reveals nothing more than squalor. After staging a bit of a "civil war" scene and taking their perceived due, the party heads back to the northern sundered door that leads to a large room. Inside, there are three more doors, as well as a kind of makeshift altar, adorned with many candles that appears to have seen recent use. There is also a journal/text that describes in some detail, the religious history of Port Perseverance, and a silver medallion featuring an apple-and-open-palm motif, both of which the party take.
					<br><Br>The party heads west (all the other unopened doors ultimately prove impassible) and carefully navigate a long corridor that ends in another door. At the midpoint, Korban detects a cunningly hidden pressure plate connected to yet another paint trap, and the party avoids it. He is not so fortunate when picking the upcoming lock, as on his third unsuccessful attempt, the locks sprays him in the face with white paint, before opening. Inside is a chest with two magical scrolls and a note, the author bidding the party "meet me upstairs". After magically disguising himself as the now deceased thief, Korban heads upstairs, prepared for the worst, but only finds Dug, who set up this elaborate exercise as a test of the party's abilities and curiosity. He explains that if the party is inclined, he would be as forthcoming as possible about the city, its people, and anything they discover, in exchange for gaining access to more of the basement system, including levels further down. It is noon.
