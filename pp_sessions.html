			The party, consisting of human lawful good male paladin Jamfalcon Dawntracker, dwarven chaotic good female wizard Ezri Laughshield, and human chaotic neutral beguiler Korban Rask begin the campaign passed out at the end of a pier near an industrial seaport at about 6 am of what we will refer to as Day 1. Korban looks like a crazy-eyed Tom Petty, with a creepy hat. Jamfalcon looks like smelly Jake Gyllenhaal.
<br><br>
Ezri is awoken by kicks from a young waif who instructs her to seek out Master Dino, younger brother of Yarto (who she claims is the greatest warrior since the Unimpeachable herself), who’s looking for them. She directs them to the Lusty Penny. Before they can leave the pier they are on, they are set upon by two vaguely foreign sounding human toughs, who are looking for a good mugging. At Korban’s mention of Yarto, they lose interest and wander off.
<br><br>
As they approach the Lusty Penny, they encounter Charly the itinerant preacher, delivering an impromptu sermon before being escorted back to lockup for this very crime. He makes veiled references to a martyr named Lucius, and the legality of faith.
<br><br>
Inside the Lusty Penny, the party meets Josef, a young employee who is mopping up from last night’s revelry, and Jamfalcon doesn't ask too many questions about Korban's gifted boot. Unwilling to ask him directly about Dino, they consult a drunkard named Harrold and eventually learn from Josef that they just missed Dino, as he was headed to the Salty Siren next. Ezri invents the game of Coasters amidst very impressive card shuffling sounds, and Harrold goes 1 for 2. Not a bad record for an ad hoc con with arbitrary rules.
<br><br>
A passerby indicates to the party the location of the Salty Siren, and they head off NE. Along the way they hear a rumour of the Crimson Forgery and Emerald Palace being tagged in the same night, whatever that means. The party eventually comes to the Salty Siren, and are denied entry by a large violent bouncer, but bluff their way into the service entrance via a telekinetic letter box clang, and an illusory potato sack.
<br><br>
The party distracts the kitchen staff with a loud TK pot clang, and proceed to the dining room, in which they see a greeter, a couple patrons and wait staff, and a bartender. Korban approaches the elderly bartender, who is the epitome of charm and hospitality. He indicates Dino was just here, and that he was off to the Crimson Forgery in a hurry, and that it was an odd time of day for his old man to summon him (who is a friend of his). It is about 10 am. The party members do a round of shots and waltz out the front door of the Salty Siren like they own the place, now wearing clean, if ill-fitting clothes, and a decided lack of repellent odour. Except maybe Jamfalcon.
