			<div class="expandable" id="expandable-0">
				<div class="revealed">
					The party began their adventure in the nation of Murasa, a state on the edge of extinction, 
					driven there by a mysterious blight known as “The Withering”. Fifteen years previous, the borders of the 
					Wither began to expand rapidly in Murasa, resulting in a mass migration to the Western, coastal regions 
					(primarily the capital; Terimbehre). The Council struggled to keep the population under control, 
					as food and housing grew increasingly limited. Demands to evacuate the city went ignored, due 
					in part to lack of options - the small island nations to the North closed their borders to further refugees. 

					<BR><BR>
					There was one faint hope. The oldest maps in Terimbehre showed a vast continent, Kebora, far to the West. 
					However, no ship had ever returned from the Kivu Ocean in living memory and the Abantu seafarers refused all 
					commissions. The Council had previously sent most of what few ships they still controlled, loaded with 
					settlers and supplies, to attempt the crossing. Nothing had been heard since and all magical attempts at 
					communication had failed. A lottery was held in Terimbehre to select a limited number of civilians for a second journey.

					Beth Rogan, Chuck Squashblossom and Harren Treefriend were three of the lucky winners (though how much "luck" had to do with it 
					depends on who you ask). Crossing through the increasingly agitated city, they met met up with their contact Zeke, to arrange passage 
					to the Rakoro. After helping him (with great reluctance) load the last of the supplies and standing down a crowd of dock thugs, 
					the party soon found themselves aboard the unusual Rakoro, headed out to sea.

			<div>	<p class="expand" id="expand-1">&#9735; Session 1 - "Try the potatoes"</p></div>
			<div class="expandable" id="expandable-1">
				<div class="revealed">
					Having made it onto the Rakoro, the party was scarce able to find their bearings before a commotion arose on the docks behind them. 
					A large, richly dressed man stood shouting at the ship as it left, claiming that his three spots aboard the ship had been stolen. 
					After ordering one of his guards to fire upon the ship, the man was struck down by a pillar of fire brought into being by another 
					Rakoro passenger - Nirari, leader of the Preserver members on the ship.
					
					<BR><BR>
					Once the excitement died down, the party met with Ordell, the ship's captain, and were assigned jobs by Zeke (<b>which they 
					promised to faithfully complete</b>). As the days passed they noticed a distinct tension between the Preserver guards and the 
					settlers on board, but after suggesting armed revolt to a horrified Mugisha (a peaceful religious leader), the party avoided getting 
					involved in any disputes.
					
					<BR><BR>
					<center><img src="/images/dnd_2016-07-23.jpg" width="500"></center>
					<BR><BR>
					
					When not busy chopping potatoes or performing comedy routines for the common deck (to mixed reviews), Beth, Chuck and Harren investigated 
					the Rakoro. While attempting to pick a locked door in the hold they managed to jam the lock completely. Chuck managed to bash the lock off, 
					and realizing that their break-in would be noticed, the party decided to replace it with a new one. One which presumably did not match the 
					key of the original lock's owner. The party then took nothing from the room, "in case they noticed". 
					
					<BR><BR>
					As part of their investigation of the strange magical runes covering the Rakoro, the party decided to spy on the cabin occupied 
					by the Preservers. With the half-elven first mate Dikotsi looking on in confusion, the party clambered past in their climbing 
					gear as part of a "routine cabin inspection". Peering into the room, they witnessed Nirari and his apprentice Gahiji 
					undertaking a ritual clearly related to the engergy flowing through the ship's runes.
					
				</div>
			</div>

			<div>	<p class="expand" id="expand-2">&#9735; Session 2 - Not a drop to drink</p></div>
			<div class="expandable" id="expandable-2">
				<div class="revealed">
					The party are visited in their small cabin by the first mate Dikotsi, and a dwarven settler, Einar. The pair had noticed the 
					party's investigation of the ship, and had decided to share their own findings and plans with the group. Einar reveals that the 
					ship's glyphs are protective in nature, though something about their use feels "wrong". The party agreed to investigate the 
					Preserver cabin for further clues.
					
					<BR><BR>
					With Chuck standing lookout, Beth and Harren snuck into the cabin and began their search. Amongst the numerous tomes in the room 
					they uncovered a <a href="/items/coded_journal.html">coded journal</a>, and were successfully able to decipher most of its contents. 
					They discovered that despite understanding little about the artifact, the Preservers were using a mysterious orb to channel power 
					into the ship's magical defenses, in order for the Rakoro to survive its journey across the Kivu ocean.
					
					<BR><BR>

					<BR><BR>
					While the party mulled over their discoveries, numerous shades manifested on the Rakoro. While not overtly aggressive, they 
					responded with force when confronted, but withdrew after contaminating most of the ship's fresh water supplies. It was then decided 
					that the Rakoro would detour to an island marked on one of the captain's ancient charts, to search for supplies. During this meeting, 
					both Gahiji and the party agreed to be part of the group that would leave the ship to explore.
				</div>

			<div>	<p class="expand" id="expand-3">&#9735; Session 3 - "Wait, they have knees?"</p></div>
			<div class="expandable" id="expandable-3">
				<div class="revealed">
					As the Rokoro arrived at the island of Qalin, several vicious Sahuagin climbed the sides of the ship 
					to attack the crew. The fish-folk were quickly brought to their <b>knees</b> by the party, and an uncomfortably long debate on how edible 
					the creatures might be was interrupted by the crew readying the expedition to depart. Shortly after landing and setting up camp, Beth discovered 
					that Gahiji had secretly left the group, and the party attempted to follow.
					
					<BR><BR>
					After raiding an old cellar for its Dwarven spirits, the party headed north, passing an abandoned watchtower standing at the mouth of a valley headed north. 
					Harren noticed that the cliffs surrounding them appear to have been raised suddenly, as if during an earthquake or similar event. Continuing onwards, 
					the party reached an "unnaturally" occurring jungle, which concealed several ruined structures and monuments. They discovered Gahiji at once such location, 
					seemingly intent on a second magical orb. The ritual was interrupted as numerous skeletal figures (both elven and dwarven) emerged from the jungle floor to the attack. 
					The party managed to fight the creatures off, but Gahiji escaped.
					
					<BR><BR>

					<BR><BR>
					
					The party continued north to a desolate wasteland, matching the description of the Wither areas back in Murasa. Chuck and Harren ventured briefly into a crater near the 
					center and acquired a mysterious lump of unrefined metal, before heading south again. Finding that Gahiji was not in camp, the group wandered east, encountering a strange group of creatures fishing outside of an overgrown cave. 
					Unable to communicate, the party slaughtered the poor goblins without mercy, despite their (hypothetically) peaceful overtures.

			<div>	<p class="expand" id="expand-4">&#9735; Session 4 - More warmongering</p></div>
			<div class="expandable" id="expandable-4">
				<div class="revealed">
					Beth, Chuck and Harren continued their murderous rampage into the goblin cave, and then through a narrow passage that led down into an ancient refugee complex. Here they encountered 
					a relatively peaceful clan of <a href="/npc/ughr.html">Ughr</a> and a not-so-peaceful swarm of goblins. Making their way through the crumbling hallways, Harren 
					avoided elective goblin surgery, and then liberated the local wolf population. Beth wandered off from the group and was confronted by two goblins (with a total of six arms), and brutally 
					strangled one of them to death. Chuck somehow passed his move silently check, but then failed his reflex save and gets stenched (again). The party narrowly avoids a bad case of goblin crabs.

			<div class="expandable" id="expandable-5">
				<div class="revealed">

				Moving further into the depths of the complex, they stumbled upon a host of goblins busy bludgeoning each other unconscious as they kick an old skull about. Interrupting the game, the party massacred 
				the last of the noble goblin athletes and uncovered some ancient scrolls and armour. They also discovered Gahiji slinking about the area and decided to question him about his recent actions.
				After a brief but tense confrontation, Gahiji and the party agreed to make their way back to the expedition camp site together.
				
				<BR><BR>
				<center><img src="/images/dnd_2016-11-05.jpg" width="500"></center>
				<BR><BR>
				
				When the group arrived back at camp, they found the rest of the expedition hurriedly packing up to leave, reporting that numerous undead (similar to those the party 
				encountered in the jungle) were converging on that location. The party fought their way to the boats, with Chuck covering the retreat, Harren healing Chuck's many, many wounds 
				and Beth fire-bombing anything that moved. Despite the appearance of a mysterious undead creature and the near drowning of a loot-hungry fighter, the group made it safely off of 
				the island with only a few casualties.

			<div>	<p class="expand" id="expand-6">&#9735; Session 6 - Brig over troubled waters</p></div>
			<div class="expandable" id="expandable-6">
				<div class="revealed">
					Having returned to the Rakoro one Preserver guard lighter, the party discovers that much has happened in their absence. The ghostly figures that appeared onboard days earlier 
					have been returning frequently, with multiple sightings each night while the ship was at rest. Tensions between bullies amongst the Guard and the civilian passengers continued to 
					mount, with the threat of open conflict breaking out. And an incident amongst the settlers themselves has led to two of them being imprisoned in the bilge deck - the drunk Ntwali and 
					the hot-headed (but well intentioned) Neza. Neza's husband pleaded with the party to intervene (as Ordell would soon have had no choice but to release Ntwali) and they sprang into 
					action.
					
					<BR><BR>
					<center><img src="/images/dnd_2016-12-03.jpg" width="500"></center>
					<BR><BR>
					
					Rather than attempt to sway Nirari (the nearest official capable of passing judgement) to punish Ntwalai, or convince his wife Iragena to move out with the children, or any other 
					predictable course of action, Beth and Harren decided to hand Ntwali a flask of spirits spiked with <i>an enormous amount of mysterious fungus spores</i>, superficial exposure to which had 
					left Chuck violently nauseated on the island. The Neutral / Chaotic Good duo then added an additional lock to his makeshift cell, ensuring that no help was forthcoming, while the Lawful Neutral 
					Chuck made a token effort to question their actions.  The fungus spores (each dose capable of permeating a 25 square foot area) reached Ntwali's liquor-augmented digestive tract, and events took a turn.
					
					<BR><BR>
					Eventually realizing that death via sudden onset dysentery was perhaps too harsh a punishment (or just not wanting to ruin another pair of shoes), Beth eventually freed Ntwali from his cell, after 
					extracting a promise that he would never again raise a hand to his family. Having resolved the issue in suitable heroic fashion, the party then reluctantly returned their attention to helping Dikotsi and Einar 
					uncover what Nirari and Gahiji were up to. The Rakoro was caught up in a sudden and unnatural storm as the matter came to a head, with the Preserver duo making clear their intent to use the strange, energy channelling 
					orb to power the ship's defenses, and First Mate Dikotsi making equally clear his intent to stop them (at sword point).

			<div>	<p class="expand" id="expand-7">&#9735; Session 7 - Shipwrecked</p></div>
			<div class="expandable" id="expandable-7">
				<div class="revealed">
					The party decided to join Dikotsi in his assault on the guards, as Nirari retreated into the cabin to summon the power of the orb. Showing no quarter, Beth, Chuck and Harren slew 
					or rendered unconscious (or rendered unconscious and then left burning to death) each of their foes, including the Preserver apprentice Gahiji. They burst into the cabin just in time 
					to see Nirari vanish in front of them. As the storm continued to swell around them, the party heard an ominous voice speaking telepathically, promising their destruction. The monsterous 
					creature Kinone then attacked the main deck, but was driven off by the quick-thinking efforts of the party and ship's wizard, who cooperated to drive the beast off of the ship. The Rakoro 
					had taken on too much damage however, and the passengers began a desperate evacuation
					
					<BR><BR>

					<BR><BR>
					
					Chuck hastily assembled a makeshift raft, while Harren and Beth loaded it with what supplies they could quickly scrounge and cast off. Encountering Iranzi, the guard leader, floating 
					helpless in a barrel, they graciously allowed him to hitch a ride (so long as he kept his distance). Eventually they began to approach land, their first sight of the new continent Kebora. 
					Despite their valiant attempt to navigate a series of treacherous rocks safely, the raft broke apart on the shoals, with the party managing to drag themselves onto the shore.

			<div>	<p class="expand" id="expand-8">&#9735; Session 8 - Short for Billothy</p></div>
			<div class="expandable" id="expandable-8">
				<div class="revealed">
				Having arrived relatively safe and sound on solid land, the party passed the night in a nearby cave, before setting out to explore this new area. Harren was able to keep them fed by foraging for 
				edible plants and berries (sadly no potatoes) and the party discovered an abandoned cabin, leading them to a desolate forest ruin inhabited by a distinctly unfriendly giant snake. Fighting their way 
				free, the group made their way to a small peninsula, where they spent a fearful night huddled amongst the scrub trees, listening to the crash of some large creature wandering about the coast below. In 
				they morning, they quickly travelled back along the western coastline, where they encountered a frightened young man, Bill. Bill had managed to escape a nearby gang of bandits, and with a few threats 
				(and lack of real options), he led the party back to the entrance, where they managed to ambush a returning patrol.
				
				<BR><BR>
				<center><img src="/images/dnd_2017-02-25.jpg" width="500"></center>
				<BR><BR>
				
				One of the other prisoners managed to free themselves in the confusion and finished off the last bandit before warily thanking the party for their timely arrival, and for their return of a strange badge 
				found on one of the thugs. She introduced herself as <a href="/npc/vaetr.html#expand-20"  rel="external">Dirge</a>, and led them to the remaining captives: John, Paula and Ollin (the lookout from the Rakoro).
					
				</div>
			</div>
			
			
			
			<div>	<p class="expand" id="expand-9">&#9735; Session 9 - Limb Disks and Dirge Badges</p></div>
			<div class="expandable" id="expandable-9">
				<div class="revealed">
				After chatting with the bandits' prisoners to see who seemed most <s>profitable</s> in need of help, the party spent the night in peaceful slumber / darting suspicious glances at everyone. 
				In the morning, they decided they would help <a href="/npc/vaetr.html#expand-20"  rel="external">Dirge</a> track down the rest of her squad, from whom she had been separated during an ambush. Taking pity on the other prisoners (or in need of new cannon fodder with Billothy's 
				escape), they agreed to escort Paula and John back to their village, and allowed Ollin to tag-along.
				
				<BR><BR>
				
				Arriving at an empty campsite, the party discovered that the remnants of Dirge's squad had left to hole up in a tavern in the near-by village. They made their way there, dropping off Paula as they approached. Inside they 
				met Dirge's two remaining squad members: <a href="/npc/vaetr.html#expand-21"  rel="external">Sour</a> and <a href="/npc/vaetr.html#expand-22"  rel="external">Thumbs</a> (now "Corporal Thumbs"). After some internal discussion (along with helpful asides from Thumbs), the soldiers decided to share some of <a href="/npc/vaetr">their story</a> with the party. As night 
				approached, Beth, Chuck and Harren reluctantly agreed to drop John off at the local farm where he lived before calling it a night.
				
				<BR><BR>
				
				The party made their way to the farm, where they found a pile of bodies, a pool of blood and failing torches. As they eagerly looted the owner's corpse, they sensed the approach of a monstrous creature. Rushing out to give battle, 
				they came very close to learning the value of healing up between fights, as the foul Blood Troll refused to stay down. Luckily (though not surprisingly) the party was loaded with fire-starting potential, and Harren's spell finished 
				the beast, as Chuck gingerly tried to poke at the flaming corpse and Beth shot arrows from the safety of the roof. The group staggered back to the farmhouse to rest, heal, and continue debating whether or not to sell John into slavery.

			<div>	<p class="expand" id="expand-10">&#9735; Session 10 - A Fruit-based Economy</p></div>
			<div class="expandable" id="expandable-10">
				<div class="revealed">
					The night passed without further disturbance, and the party headed back into town, after flipping the distraught John a coin "<i>for his troubles</i>". Engaging in some spirited haggling with the local shopkeep, Chuck managed to lighten some of the party's 
					load - though they kept their set of Dwarven teeth dice in the hope of selling them to the elusive "Johnny Two-Towns" down the road. The group then made their way to the local tavern to check in with Dirge and the rest of her squad. 
					After passing on <a href="/npc/vaetr.html#expand-22"  rel="external">Thumbs'</a> invitation to go hunting (for what exactly was never specified), Harren, Beth and Chuck headed inside and met with <a href="/npc/vaetr.html#expand-21"  rel="external">Sour</a>, who seemed eager to talk to them. He mentioned detecting a strange "blind spot" in the Western forest during his 
				daily scrying of the area for reconnaissance. Persuading the party to investigate for him (offering an undefined reward), Sour provided the group with a simple tracking device. After bartering with two travelling merchants, the trio set off.
				
				<BR><BR>
				As the party entered the forest, they noticed an unusual stillness, which increased as they made their way towards the strange phenomenon mentioned by Sour. As they drew closer, they discovered several sets of tracks heading North, as well as some indication of a 
				running battle. Eventually, they discovered a casualty - a hostile reptilian humanoid who revealed that its kind (<a href="/npc/gell">"the Gell"</a>) were hunting an elvish group headed North. After interrogating the creature (including some impromptu plum-boarding), the party continued following 
				the tracks, reaching a battle between more of the Gell and a group of half-elves. 
				
				<BR><BR>
				
				After considerable (some might even say "callous") deliberation, Chuck, Harren and Beth passively snuck closer to the engagement, waiting for their moment to contribute. As the watched, they noticed an anti-magic field surrounding a cloaked member of the elven party - who 
				seemed nonetheless disturbed by the magical attacks of a Gell Shaman. The battle threatened to turn with the arrival of the Hill Giant Klagg, but a timely application of the group's bear-trap and focused attacks managed to bring the giant down. Dropping the Gell leader with 
				an arrow in the back, the party exchanged greetings with the elven group, learning that the half-elves were an escort for the pure-blooded elf prince <a href="/npc/reach_elves.html#expand-20"  rel="external">Rudzi</a>. The group travelled from a place known as <a href="/npc/reach_elves.html">"The Reach"</a>, and were heading North for a <a href="/events/northern_treaty.html">treaty signing</a> between several 
				of the prominent local factions. The half-elf Speaker <a href="/npc/reach_elves.html#expand-21"  rel="external">Hulsani</a> thanked the party for helping with their injured companions, but firmly refused the use of Harren's magical aid. The elven group then left heading North, as the party rummaged through the pockets of the fallen.
