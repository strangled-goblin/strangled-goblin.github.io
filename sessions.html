					The party will began their adventure in the nation of Murasa, a state on the edge of extinction, 
					driven there by a mysterious blight known as “The Withering”. Fifteen years ago the borders of the 
					Wither began to expand rapidly in Murasa, resulting in a mass migration to the Western, coastal regions 
					(primarily the capital; Terimbehre). The Council struggled to keep the population under control, 
					as food and housing grew increasingly limited. Demands to evacuate the city went ignored, due 
					in part to lack of options - the small island nations to the North closed their borders to further refugees. 

					<BR><BR>
					There was one faint hope. The oldest maps in Terimbehre showed a vast continent, Kebora, far to the West. 
					However, no ship had ever returned from the Kivu Ocean in living memory and the Abantu seafarers refused all 
					commissions. The Council had previously sent most of what few ships they still controlled, loaded with 
					settlers and supplies, to attempt the crossing. Nothing had been heard since and all magical attempts at 
					communication had failed. A lottery was held in Terimbehre to select a limited number of civilians for a second journey.

					<BR><BR>
					Beth Rogan, Chuck Squashblossom and Harren Treefriend were three of the lucky winners (though how much "luck" had to do with it 
					depends on who you ask). Crossing through the increasingly agitated city, they met met up with their contact Zeke, to arrange passage 
					to the Rakoro. After helping him (with great reluctance) load the last of the supplies and standing down a crowd of dock thugs, 
					the party soon found themselves aboard the unusual Rakoro, headed out to sea.
