		<h1>Overview</h1>
		<div id="overview">
		While investigating the Rakoro quarters occupied by the Preservers Gahiji and Nirari, Beth discovered an encoded journal. Working quickly, she and Haren were able to translate some of the contents, which revealed how the Preservers first discovered the orb used to power the Rakoro's defenses.
