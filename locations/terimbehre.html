		<h1>Overview</h1>
		<div id="overview">
			Terimbehre is the capital of the republic of Murasa, located on the western coast of the small continent of N'Tare. Fifteen years before the party started on their journey, a rapid expansion of the long dormant <a href="wither.html">Wither</a> in central Murasa drove many refugees into the city, though few were able to secure the transport elsewhere they were seeking. 

			<BR><BR>
			Terimbehre is ruled (at least in theory) by a collection of statesmen known as the Red Council. <a href="preservers.html">The Preservers</a>, a religious faction whose power has grown dramatically in the previous decade, control much of the city's resources, while their leader <a href="#expand-5" onclick="$('#expandable-5').show();">Isaro Cydalia</a> serves as First Minister. The Council struggles to keep the Murasan population under control, as food and housing grow increasingly limited. Demands to evacuate the city have been ignored, due in part to lack of options. The only nearby lands are several small island nations to the North, which have closed their borders to further refugees.

		<h1>Discovered Locations</h1>
			<div>	<p class="expand" id="expand-1">&#9735; City Barracks</p></div>
			<div class="expandable" id="expandable-1">
				<p class="revealed">The Terimbehre City Guard have effectively been folded into the ranks of the <a href="preservers.html">Preservers</a>, though some members still loyal to the Red Council remain. While working for <a href="#expand-6" onclick="$('#expandable-6').show();">Zeke</a> to load supplies from a dock <a href="wither.html">warehouse</a>, the party discovered a cache of Guard uniforms, plans and a map of the nearest barracks, suggesting that some of the local populance had been planning an attack or revolt.</p>
			</div>
		
			<div>	<p class="expand" id="expand-2">&#9735; Market</p></div>
			<div class="expandable" id="expandable-2">
				<p class="revealed"><i>"As you make your way towards the harbour you see various signs of the city’s distress. The once bustling market square has been reduced to a few dozen stalls, mostly peddling fake charms against the Wither. All of the food stalls have closed, as the Guard instituted rationing a month ago. The people aren’t starving, yet, but a sense of desperation is obvious. The city Guard are stationed on nearly every corner, watching for trouble. Signs of protest are clear, with several painted messages blaming the <a href="preservers.html">Preservers</a> for the hardship. Guardian Isaro hasn’t yet instituted martial law, but rumours suggest it could happen as early as next week."</i></p>

			<div>	<p class="expand" id="expand-3">&#9735; Warehouse</p></div>
			<div class="expandable" id="expandable-3">
				<div class="revealed">
					<i>"You arrive at the agreed upon location, a small dock on the little-used Southern side of the harbour. A ramshackle building is perched on the end of the pier, and a rowboat is moored next to it. As you step inside the warehouse you are hit with the smell of dust and mildew. Light from the open door and several gaps in the wooden walls reveal a large single room, with piles of crates, sacks and bags stacked haphazardly. You are able to see roughly thirty feet before the dimness hides the rest of the warehouse from view. Towards the back of the room you see a cleared spot amongst the boxes, near a set of loading doors that clearly haven’t been used in years. You see the sacks of salt Zeke asked for a few feet ahead, but the crate and barrel must be somewhere else in the gloom."</i>

					A non-descript warehouse near the docks was the appointed location to meet Zeke, quartermaster for the <a href="rakoro.html">Rakoro</a>. Before the party could row out to the ship, they helped Zeke load the remaining supplies onto his boat, fighting off several rats and uncovering clues to an attack on the city barracks.

			<div>	<p class="expand" id="expand-4">&#9735; Docks</p></div>
			<div class="expandable" id="expandable-4">
				<div class="revealed">
					<i>"You look up to see a crowd of men approaching, several of them armed with makeshift weapons. Zeke mutters to you under your breath: “They’re after the boat. We can’t let them take it, but if a brawl breaks out the Guard will have all of us locked up until they can sort it out. The Captain will wait for a little while, but if we’re not on board by sunset he’ll have to leave. See if you can talk some sense into these idiots.”. The group comes to a stop 10 feet away. A large man in tattered black leather armor gestures to the rowboat with a rusted shortsword: “We’ll be taking that boat now. You don’t have to get hurt, but we’re not taking no for an answer.” Another man lost in the crowd yells: “You tell ‘em Bill! We’re getting out of this hellhole!”</i>
					<BR><BR>
					Before the party was able to leave for the <a href="rakoro.html">Rakoro</a>, they were confronted by a group of thugs, desparate to seize their boat in order to escape the city. Thinking quickly, the party bluffed the men into backing down, using the recently discovered Guard uniforms to reinforce their story.

    <h1>Notable NPCs</h1>
		<div id="npcs">
		
			<div>	<p class="expand" id="expand-5">&#9735; Isaro Cydalia</p></div>
			<div class="expandable" id="expandable-5">
				<p class="revealed">Despite being the leader of the <a href="preservers.html">Preserver</a> faction and acting First Minister of the Red Council of Terimbehre, little is known about Isaro. He first rose to prominance in the Perserver ranks three years before the party departed Terimbehre, with little public knowledge available about his past before this point. The party has not yet encountered Isaro.</p>

			<div>	<p class="expand" id="expand-6">&#9735; Zeke</p></div>
			<div class="expandable" id="expandable-6">
				<div class="revealed">
					<i>“Good. You lot look like you can carry your own weight. Not another desperate family trading one hopeless situation for another. I’m Zeke, Quartermaster for the Rakoro. You keep your hands off of what doesn’t belong to you and jump when the Captain says, and we’ll get along just fine"</i>
					<BR><BR>
					Zeke is the quartermaster of the <a href="rakoro.html">Rakoro</a>, a ship that left Terimbehre for the continent of <a href="kabora.html">Kabora</a>. His appearance is that of a middle-aged man with dark hair mostly run to gray, weathered from a life on the sea. The party first encountered Zeke as their contact for securing passage on the Rakoro, and have helped him with several small tasks in the past. In return, he has consented to buy and sell small items from the party (though he can't always remember agreeing to the purchase afterwards). Zeke was last seen aboard the Rakoro as it floundered, when the party abandoned ship.
